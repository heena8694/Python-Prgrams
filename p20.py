# Question 21
# A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps. The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:
# UP 5
# DOWN 3
# LEFT 3
# RIGHT 2
# The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program to compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.
# Example:
# If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
# UP 5
# DOWN 3
# LEFT 3
# RIGHT 2
# Then, the output of the program should be:
# 2
# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
