# program 35 :

# Define a function which can generate a dictionary
# where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included)
# and the values are square of keys. The function should just print the
# values only.

# Hints:
# Use dict[key]=value pattern to put entry into a dictionary.
# Use ** operator to get power of a number.
# Use range() for loops.
# Use keys() to iterate keys in the dictionary. Also we can use item() to
# get key/value pairs.
